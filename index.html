                <p class="postText" id="EdsgerInfo">
                    (11 May 1930 - 6 August 2002) was a Dutch computer scientist, programmer, software engineer, systems scientist, 
                    and science essayist. He received the 1972 Turing Award for fundamental contributions to developing structured programming 
                    languages, and was the Schlumberger Centennial Chair of Computer Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin from 1984 
                    until 2000. Shortly before his death in 2002, he received the <abbr>ACM PODC</abbr>(Association for Computing Machinery 
                    Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing Influential Paper Award) in distributed computing for his work on 
                    self-stabilization of program computation. This annual award was renamed the Dijkstra Prize the following year, in his honor.

                <h2 class="underlined">Alan Turing:</h2>
                <p class="postText" id="AlanInfo">
                    (23 June 1912 - 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, 
                    and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing 
                    a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model 
                    of a general-purpose computer. He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial 
                    intelligence. Born in Maida Vale, London, Turing was raised in southern England.<br> He graduated at King's College, 
                    Cambridge, with a degree in mathematics. Whilst he was a fellow at Cambridge, he published a proof demonstrating that 
                    some purely mathematical yesâ€“no questions can never be answered by computation and defined a Turing machine, and went 
                    on to prove that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable. In 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department 
                    of Mathematics at Princeton University. During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) 
                    at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was 
                    responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, 
                    including improvements to the pre-war Polish bomba method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma 
                    machine. Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers 
                    in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic. After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, 
                    where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the first designs for a stored-program computer.<br> In 1948, Turing 
                    joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester 
                    computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted 
                    oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousovâ€“Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. Despite these accomplishments, 
                    Turing was never fully recognised in Britain during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.

                <h2 class="underlined">Linus Torvalds:</h2>
                <p class="postText" id="LinusInfo">
                    (born 28 December 1969) is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator and, historically, the lead developer of the 
                    Linux kernel, used by Linux distributions and other operating systems such as Android. He also created the distributed version control 
                    system Git. He was honored, along with Shinya Yamanaka, with the 2012 Millennium Technology Prize by the Technology Academy Finland 
                    "in recognition of his creation of a new open source operating system for computers leading to the widely used Linux kernel." 
                    He is also the recipient of the 2014 IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award and the 2018 IEEE Masaru Ibuka Consumer Electronics 
                    Award.

                <h2 class="underlined">Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace:</h2>
                <p class="postText" id="AdaInfo">
                    (10 December 1815 - 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's 
                    proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications 
                    beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is 
                    often regarded as the first computer programmer. Ada Byron was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and Lady Byron. All 
                    of Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and 
                    left England forever. Four months later, he commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, "Is thy face like thy mother's my fair 
                    child! ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart?" He died in Greece when Ada was eight. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's 
                    interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada 
                    remained interested in him, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although 
                    often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 
                    1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.

<!-- We developed our site using two different computers - one running windows 11, the other running MacOS, during testing (on google chrome, microsoft edge and safari) we encountered no difference in our website, we did however have problems with our print functionality. Using the Chrome page printer the table would be too wide and go out of the bounds of the page
therefore we decided to change the style of the table when printing so that it fits no matter the size (using display:flex). We tested our mobile functionality using Chrome Dev Tools. With the help of this tool we came to the conclusion that having a horizontal table was impractical and ugly, so we opted to have our table span vertically when the screen size is sufficiently small (using display:flex). -->

<!-- To comply with the WCAG 1.1 guideline we provide alternative text to all images on our page, for 1.3 we use flex design and a grid layout that automatically changes structure depending on the resolution and device positioning.
1.4 -  we use clear contrasting colors for any and all data representation. 2.1 - the entire page can be easily traversed using only the tab button, all information and all links can be accessed without the use of the mouse.
2.4 We gave purpose to each link and eased the navigation by not creating large spaces between the texts.-->
